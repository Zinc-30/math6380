% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Methodology}
We tested both the original model (\textit{Original}) and the model with extension of $w_1$ (\textit{Extended}). For both models we used the same training settings, with epoch=1000, batch size=1000, learning rate=0.001, and initial weights following Gaussian distribution.

%\subsection{feature engeneering}
%The feature dimension of this dataset is not quite high. And they all have actual meanings, presenting dosage levels of 20 different drugs. So we didn't manually create other features using their combinations.
% To cope with the high-dimension of features and prevent the learning algorithms from overfitting, we performed dimension reduction or feature selection on features.  We compared severial regression methods including LASSO, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting.  Two python packages:scikit-learn and pandas were used in the implementation. \\
% We also manually implemented a recursive feature selection method from scratch based on Lasso regression errors on cross validation data. Different from Lasso recursive feature elimination in the reference poster which repeatly eliminates some features, our feature selection method repeatly add a feature until the Lasso regression error on validation dataset does not decrease. The advantage of our method is that it is more efficient than recursive feature elimination. 

% \subsection{model selection}
% In this part, We did 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset for model selection. Our models includes LASSO, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression, Elastic Net and Gradient Boosting. \\
% We think the key point of this project is how to tune the parameters.

\section{Remark on Contributions}
The project is finished under the discussion and close collaboration of our group members. Jinxing Yu wrote the code skeleton and wrote the model part. Hao Xin and Xun Jian proposed different changes to the models. Hao Xin wrote the introduction part and Xun Jian wrote the discussion part.
