\section{introduction}
We choosed combinatorial drug 20 efficacy data and participated in the kaggle inclass contest.  We are the team "3654". Our best submission gets \textbf{0.01193} Mean-Square-Error. 
The dataset contains 140 cancer cell line samples in response to a combination of 20 drugs in 4 dosage levels. There are the discrete dosage levels of 20 drugs, and the real valued response as viability measured by difference between normalized cells and cancer cells. The higher is the viability, the more effective is the drug combination. 120 of the cells viability information are known, our job is to predict the rest 20 cells' viability.
So the sample size of the datasets is 120, and the features dimension is 20.
